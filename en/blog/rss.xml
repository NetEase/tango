With Tango, you only need a few lines of code to build a basic low-code platform frontend system. The Tango low-code designer directly reads the source code of the frontend project, executes and renders the frontend view based on the source code, and provides users with low-code visual building capabilities. User's building operations will be translated into modifications to the source code. With low-code tools or platforms built using Tango, it is possible to achieve the effect of "source code in, source code out" and seamlessly integrate with the existing R&amp;D system within the enterprise.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_fF9Z" id="-features">✨ Features<a href="#-features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ✨ Features" title="Direct link to ✨ Features">​</a></h3><ul><li>After actual testing in the production environment of NetEase Cloud Music, it can be flexibly integrated and applied to low-code platforms, local development tools, and more.</li><li>Driven by source code AST, with no private DSL and protocols.</li><li>Provides real-time code output capability, supports source code input and output.</li><li>Out-of-the-box front-end low-code designer, providing flexible and easy-to-use designer React components.</li><li>Developed using TypeScript, providing complete type definition files.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_fF9Z" id="️-code-based-low-code-solution">🏗️ Code-based Low-Code Solution<a href="#️-code-based-low-code-solution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🏗️ Code-based Low-Code Solution" title="Direct link to 🏗️ Code-based Low-Code Solution">​</a></h3><p>Due to the fact that the engine kernel is completely based on the source code-driven implementation, Tango low-code engine can achieve the visualization building capability of source code input and source code output, without providing any private intermediate products. If the company already has a complete R&amp;D system (code hosting, building, deployment, CDN), Tango low-code engine can be directly used to integrate with existing services to build a low-code development platform.</p><img loading="lazy" src="https://p5.music.126.net/obj/wonDlsKUwrLClGjCm8Kx/13140534982/ee2e/f42c/cc9a/184e2918a011b57d46e6c64a2722fa44.png" class="img__Ss2"><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_fF9Z" id="-code-in-code-out">📄 Code in, Code out<a href="#-code-in-code-out" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 📄 Code in, Code out" title="Direct link to 📄 Code in, Code out">​</a></h3><p>由于引擎内核完全基于源代码驱动实现，Tango 低代码引擎能够实现源代码进，源代码出的可视化搭建能力，不提供任何私有的中间产物。如果公司内部已经有了一套完善的研发体系（代码托管、构建、部署、CDN），那么可以直接使用 Tango 低代码引擎与现有的服务集成构建低代码开发平台。</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="code in, code out" src="/tango/en/assets/images/codein-codeout-e31742472c17206e1c02484da0b71468.png" width="2452" height="1078" class="img__Ss2"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_fF9Z" id="-advantages">🏆 Advantages<a href="#-advantages" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🏆 Advantages" title="Direct link to 🏆 Advantages">​</a></h3><p>Compared to the low-code building solution based on private schema, Tango low-code engine has the following advantages:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Comparison Items</th><th>Schema-base low-code solution</th><th>Tango (Code-based)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Applicable Scenarios</td><td>Targeted vertical building scenarios, such as forms, marketing pages, etc.</td><td>🔥 Applicable to application building scenarios centered on source code</td></tr><tr><td>Language Capabilities</td><td>Relies on private protocols for extension, inflexible, and difficult to align with programming language capabilities</td><td>🔥 Based directly on JavaScript language, can use all language features, no extensibility issues</td></tr><tr><td>Development Capability</td><td>LowCode</td><td>🔥 LowCode + ProCode</td></tr><tr><td>Source Code Export</td><td>Centered on schema, one-way code output, irreversible</td><td>🔥 Source code-centered, two-way transcoding</td></tr><tr><td>Custom Dependencies</td><td>Need to be encapsulated according to private protocol extension, high customization cost</td><td>🔥 Existing components can be seamlessly and low-cost integrated</td></tr><tr><td>Integrated R&amp;D Facilities</td><td>High customization cost, additional customization required</td><td>🔥 Low-cost integration, can directly reuse existing deployment and publishing capabilities</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The specific technical architecture is shown in the following figure:</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_fF9Z" id="-architecture">📐 Architecture<a href="#-architecture" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 📐 Architecture" title="Direct link to 📐 Architecture">​</a></h2><p>The Tango low-code engine has been layered and decoupled in implementation, enabling independent development and maintenance of the upper-level low-code platform and the lower-level low-code engine, allowing for fast integration and deployment. In addition, Tango's low-code engine defines an open material ecosystem, allowing developers to freely contribute to extension components and configure property setters that enhance low-code materials.</p><p>The specific technical architecture is shown in the following diagram.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="low-code engine" src="/tango/en/assets/images/lowocode-engine-c0a88703aa0cac5c1871dc3bc6f1b770.png" width="2348" height="1138" class="img__Ss2"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_fF9Z" id="-milestones">⏰ Milestones<a href="#-milestones" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ⏰ Milestones" title="Direct link to ⏰ Milestones">​</a></h2><p>Tango low-code engine is the core component of NetEase Cloud Music's internal low-code platform. Open sourcing involves a lot of decoupling work of core logic, which will bring us a lot of additional work in our normal work. Therefore, we plan to promote the open source of Tango low-code engine in stages.</p><ol><li>Today we officially released the first community version of Tango low-code engine, which will include the core code library of Tango low-code engine, TangoBoot application framework, and low-code component library adapted to antd v4.</li><li>We plan to release the 1.0 Beta version of the low-code engine on September 30th this year. This version will refactor the core implementation for community scenarios, remove some compatibility code we have internally in Cloud Music, and optimize the implementation of the core.</li><li>We plan to release the 1.0 RC version of the low-code engine on October 30th this year. This version will ensure that the core API is basically stable and no longer has BREAKING CHANGE. At the same time, we will provide comprehensive and detailed development guides, deployment documents, and demonstration applications.</li><li>The official version will be released before the end of Q4 2023, and we will further improve our open source community operation mechanism.
